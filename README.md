# Feature-extraction-of-Microarray-data
In this repository I am going to :


first, preprocessing the data set. This procedure consists of balancing the data set as the data set (colon) has not the same subject of people suffering from colon cancer and the healthy one.


second, reducing the dimension of the data set, not only can decrease the time consumption of the classifying process, but also can increaese the accuracy of the classification with much less features. this stage is conducted with several ML based methods.


third, I will compare a plenty of classifiers to determine which model is appropriate for Microarray data analysis.


At the last stage, I will check these methods on mandle data set, to grasp whether these methods are working perfectly on other domain of domain dataset or not.
